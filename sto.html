        <li><strong>Solid State Drive (SSD):</strong> A faster and more reliable storage device that uses flash memory, with no moving parts, making it more durable than an HDD.</li>
        <li><strong>USB Flash Drive:</strong> A portable storage device that connects via USB, commonly used for transferring files between computers.</li>
        <li><strong>Optical Discs (CD/DVD):</strong> Discs that store data and are read by laser; though less common now, they are still used for specific storage needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Storage:</strong> A digital storage solution where data is saved on remote servers and accessed via the internet, offering convenience and scalability.</li>
